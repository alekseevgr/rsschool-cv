## About me

I set myself the goal of becoming a developer in 2023. The main motivator is to realize your abilities and potential by 100%. After all the courses I took, I understand that the IT field will be the best way for me to implement my soft skills.

The most important skills that help me to be effective for a long time in my current professional activity:
- Expertise in client business processes and products.

I believe that this skill will be useful as a developer, because the product being developed can be in different areas, and it is very important to understand the specifics of the business in order to make fewer mistakes in work.

- Constant learning. 

I always strive to learn new products, sales techniques without any external motivators. It helps to always be efficient and improve your results.
In the IT field, this is the most important point, especially for a novice specialist. I can quickly learn the necessary technology stack and use it correctly in practice.
